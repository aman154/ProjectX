  <h1>Text-Based Game</h1>
  <p>Welcome to our text-based game!</p>
  <p>You are a brave adventurer, seeking fortune and glory in a mysterious land. You are standing in front of a dense forest, with a path leading into the trees. The air is cool and fresh, and the sound of birds chirping can be heard in the distance.</p>
  <p>What would you like to do?</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#" onclick="moveForward()">Move forward</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" onclick="moveBackward()">Move backward</a></li>
    <li><a href="#" onclick="lookAround()">Look around</a></li>
  </ul>
  <script>
    function moveForward() {
      // Code to move the player forward
      alert("You step forward, the trees growing closer as you venture deeper into the forest.");
    }

    function moveBackward() {
      // Code to move the player backward
      alert("You take a step back, the forest growing smaller as you retreat.");
    }

    function lookAround() {
      // Code to describe the player's surroundings
      alert("You take a moment to look around, the towering trees stretching up towards the sky. The path behind you winds back through the forest, while the path ahead disappears into the darkness. You see a faint light in the distance, perhaps a village or a campfire.");
    }
